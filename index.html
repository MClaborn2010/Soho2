      <h2>What we're about.</h2>
      <p>
        A community based bar & grill centered around the needs and wants of
        Homewood. A unique spin on American classics. Familiar, and yet fresh at
        the same time. There will of course be some pretty unique twists. We
        will strive to treat you like family with the hopes of earning the same
        in return. Laid back, friendly, sincere service.

      <h2>Our Menu</h2>
      <p>
        We feature a seasonal, scratch-made menu built around long time southern
        staples, presented in an imaginative and fresh way. Our evolving
        Tap-List of local beers primarily focused on Alabama’s award winning
        breweries, as well as other regional favorites. Hand made craft
        cocktails, inspired and developed by knowledgeable bartenders. A simple,
        yet unique wine list featuring wines you won’t see in stores.

      <h2>Why Homewood?</h2>
      <p>
        We chose Soho/downtown Homewood to be a gathering place central to all
        activity in the community. We want to to be a place that attracts people
        from all walks of life, from young professionals and families to
        retirees and empty nesters. Homewood has that because of its location
        and history, which is part of what makes this community so strong and
        unique.
